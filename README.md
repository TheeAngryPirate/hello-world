# hello-world
My first repository!
Hey there, my name is Austin and I'm thinkging about making my own mods for a game I absolutely love, but could use a few adjustments. I have a small background in programming, I've taken a Robotics II class in High School, but I feel like this will be a bit different. Either way I loved it and really want to see my creations come to life and so this is my first step!
